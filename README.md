## Siteviz

The idea is that we've got Chef's Ohai data or Saltstack's grains containing all sorts of data that we can present to the user.  It assumes that you've managed to create some sort of grouping system.  If not, creating an artifical one like the dict that forms the `data.json` sample data might be a good start.


TODO:

Show a represenation (N up, N down) at the group level before clicking down to the actual host level.
